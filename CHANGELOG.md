### Fixed

#### Database Connection Issues
- Fixed the database host: Updated the `POSTGRES_HOST` in both `.env` and `.env.local` to use the correct Supabase database host format: `db.xxxxx.supabase.co`.
- Improved SSL configuration: Modified the SSL configuration in both `drizzle.ts` and `drizzle.config.ts` to handle self-signed certificates by setting `rejectUnauthorized: false`.
- Enhanced environment variable loading: Updated both `drizzle.ts` and `drizzle.config.ts` to load environment variables from both `.env` and `.env.local` files, with `.env.local` taking precedence.

#### TypeScript Errors
- Fixed TypeScript errors in `seed.ts` by properly typing the `db` variable in `drizzle.ts`.
- Added proper type definitions for the database client and connection.

  - Stored original pricing page code for future reference:
    ```typescript
    // Original pricing page with Stripe integration
    import { checkoutAction } from '@/lib/payments/actions';
    import { Check } from 'lucide-react';
    import { getStripePrices, getStripeProducts } from '@/lib/payments/stripe';
    import { SubmitButton } from './submit-button';

    export const revalidate = 3600;

    export default async function PricingPage() {
      const [prices, products] = await Promise.all([
        getStripePrices(),
        getStripeProducts(),
      ]);

      const basePlan = products.find((product) => product.name === 'Base');
      const plusPlan = products.find((product) => product.name === 'Plus');

      const basePrice = prices.find((price) => price.productId === basePlan?.id);
      const plusPrice = prices.find((price) => price.productId === plusPlan?.id);

      return (
